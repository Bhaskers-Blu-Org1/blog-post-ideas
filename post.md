##### Cloud Native Development Grows Up

When we book an airline ticket, apply for a new passport, access our insurance documents or bank account, we're relying on software built by enterprise developers in corporate labs in cities around the world.

Enterprise developers are busy people. Customer's expectations are higher than they've ever been for fast, mobile, and secure access to information. We already accept that microservices, and cloud based solutions offer the only real flexible, scalable future for the enterprise. Yet only 20% of enterprise software has moved to the cloud.

Enterprise developers are often pressed for time to learn on the job. Even if they have time, it can be difficult knowing where to start with cloud native development. The technology is constantly evolving, and opinions on best tools and approaches vary even within small organizations.

Cloud Pak for Apps aims to clear some of the mystery around Cloud Native development by firstly bundling the best in class libraries and frameworks for developing secure, fast and scalable solutions, and secondly by instilling customizable and consistent access to frameworks approved by an organization.

Here is a collection of code patterns, articles and tutorials that gently introduce the concepts of Cloud Pak for Apps as a smart, disciplined and consistent approach to creating cloud native applications in the enterprise.
